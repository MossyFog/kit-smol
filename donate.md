## Public Domain Donationware
This is a public domain & donationware creation ~ donations of a 
"Pay What You Want(Including Nothing)" perspective.
As lead of the project and choosing the MD0 license, I myself urge
NO REQUIREMENT FOR ATTRIBUTION to my own work.
However
- This was made in the Godot Engine.
- This was made with external CC0 assets.
So you should consider donating to those, possibly first. For example, if a 
significant amount of enjoyment of this came from something I did not make, 


I specifically would like you, as a potential creator, to use my work without 
even needing to worry about doing much else other than using it. No one should 
be guilting you into mentioning or giving credit to me, anywhere - the license 
is quite specific on the matter.
If someone guilts you for "ripping off" my work, tell them they're wrong - you 
can point to this statement. I as author say nay.

The external CC0 or public domain content I use might be more worthy to credit, 
it may be appreciated much more, but those aren't required to do so either. I 
do so for funsies.

Anyhow, take a moment to ponder where you want your donation to go. Maybe 
divvy it out as you see fit ~ I know it may be extra clicking & typing.
I myself would highly appreciate all donations, as I tend to be frugal and 
cautious with where my money is spent, and it would likely go to survival more 
often than luxury.

I would suggest donating higher than $2, simply because transaction fees often 
take a solid $0.30, so donating only $1 gives 30% to some payment processor.

Fight, dismantle, and exile bigotry. <3
